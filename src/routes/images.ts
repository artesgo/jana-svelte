		alt: `THE CEILING

The Ceiling 45 sq meter ceiling fresco symbolically represented my and my father’s arrival to the new world from native Czechoslovakia in 1968 when Russians came in with tanks to suppress the Czech revolution.
Painted over period of 4 years while lying on my back on top of scaffolding.
With all my little babies who I painted on the ceiling while they watched me.
The ceiling was painted in Michelangelo style with gold leaf applications and filigree
Tree dimensional hand made plaster work around central chandelier rosette.
The ceiling was unique North American work that had hosted buss loads of tourist from Japan and other from USA and Canada,
Later unfortunate circumstances forced our family out of our home to the street leaving the art work behind.
During the beginning of this difficult time which lasted 6 months. Devoted 20 member committee was formed called “Friends of the Ceiling”. They felt that the ceiling was national treasure they were trying to save it. There were 4000 signatures collected during the 6 months unfortunately after all the affords this unique piece of art work was not saved
House was open to visitors every afternoon. There was sculpting and painting studio beside the main gallery with the ceiling and large canvases covering the walls.
At her end I had some of my art work stacked on the road and was going to burn it.
Friends of the ceiling stopped me from doing so... Paintings and sculptures were sold in auctions...
And I woud to stop creating for a year... this decision nearly killed me... I realized that I can not survive without creating this is my life my soul my existence...
When I came back to painting I wanted to do work that would not be permanent
Work that I could remove my self from like the Buddhist monks mantras painted with colored sand and when it is done just blow it away...
This is how and why I started painting X mass windows. Painting on a glass which is removed after period of time.`,
