		<p>I feel the pavement under my feet</p>
		<p>I feel the heat on my head</p>
		<p>I chose to feel cool instead</p>
		<p>You look at my canvas and see</p>
		<p>my feelings</p>
		<p>my anger</p>
		<p>just me</p>
		<p>You open your hart to my pain</p>
		<p>You have nothing to gain</p>
		<p>They watch us from windows above</p>
		<p>They don't feel the same love</p>
		<p>They judge our living on the street</p>
		<p>They don't want to talk and meet</p>
		<p>We have one coat, one pair of shoes</p>
		<p>We have nothing here to loose</p>

	<div class="poetry">
		<p>We are eye sore</p>
		<p>They say</p>
		<p>WHAT DOES IT MEAN</p>
		<p>ON THE END OF THE DAY</p>
		<p>Without home</p>
		<p>without food</p>
		<p>I still share and it feels good</p>
		<p>Why don't they come down to the</p>
		<p>street to feel what we feel</p>
		<p>under our feet.</p>
		<p>The street is my canvas</p>
		<p>I choose to paint</p>
		<p>although the colors are growing faint</p>
		<p>the WAVE is there in midday's light</p>
		<p>We are not giving up without a fight</p>
