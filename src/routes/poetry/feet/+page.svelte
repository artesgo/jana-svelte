    <p>I don't see it</p>
    <p>can't right now</p>
    <p>for the feet of homeless</p>
    <p>for the hands of hungry</p>
    <p>for children crying rivers of tears</p>
    <p>my head is spinning</p>
    <p>searching for a sward to fight the fears</p>
    <p>searching for bowl</p>
    <p>with never ending porridge</p>
    <p>brake down the wall</p>
    <p>with never ending courage</p>
    <p>when rivers are red</p>
    <p>and the streets are muddy</p>
    <p>all was said</p>
    <p>I lost my buddy</p>
    <p>only me</p>
    <p>feet of homeless</p>
    <p>hands of hungry</p>
    <p>children..crying..crying..crying..</p>
